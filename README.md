# Salary-Management-System-SQL-RDBMS
SQL Server - RDBMS

Abstraction:
Salary Management System is aimed at efficient management of employee information, emoluments, expenses, net payouts, calculation salary based on workdays and pay salary etc. All of these are managed through a database. This project is terminal project, which implemented using PL/SQL and oracle database. The database is divided based on different conditions, which are known as fragments, and these fragments are kept at different locations, which has Database Management System to deal with the data. The idea of dividing/fragmenting the data makes the system reliable, fast with better response. In case of database failures, the system remains functional though it may reduce performance.

Motivation:
Companies, it may be public or private increasing to fast with population growth. In addition, in every company, there is a must essential thing, a system that manage employee information and their payments. So having a well-organized Salary Management System is a market demand. Therefore, we tried to implement a smaller conceptual version of Salary Management System. In addition, as there are some large companies has distributed database system, so we focus on distributed database system in small manner so that system can perform fast and efficient ways.

Summary:
In this project, which I have implement based on some high quality Salary Management System. However, we could not implement it as a whole but tried to give an idea how distributed database work in real life scenario. We look forward to implement the project in future on a larger scale.
